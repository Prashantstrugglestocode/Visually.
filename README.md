# Visually

**Visually** is a cutting-edge, interactive educational simulator designed to demystify the complex operations of CPU cache memory hierarchies. Built with React and modern web technologies, it provides a real-time, visual representation of how data traverses between the CPU, L1 Cache, L2 Cache, and Main Memory (RAM).

Whether you are a computer architecture student or an enthusiast, Visually helps you "see" the invisible processes of computing.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Interactive System Architecture
The heart of Visually is the **System Diagram**, a clickable, animated map of the computer's memory hierarchy.
- **Visual Data Flow**: Watch requests move across buses between components.
- **Component Inspection**: Click on any component (CPU, L1, L2, RAM) to dive into its specific state and operations.
- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor Program Counter (PC) and Hit Rates directly from the overview.

### 2. AI-Powered Assistant 🤖
Integrated with **Google's Gemini API**, the built-in Chatbot acts as your personal tutor.
- **Context-Aware**: Understands questions about cache theory, RISC-V assembly, and simulator usage.
- **Heuristic Fallback**: Works even without an API key for common questions (hits/misses, associativity).
- **Customizable**: Users can bring their own API key for a full AI experience.

### 3. Deep Performance Analysis
Go beyond simple hits and misses with advanced visualization tools:
- **Power Mix Chart**: A stacked area chart visualizing energy consumption over time, breaking it down into:
    - **Static Power**: Baseline energy usage.
    - **Dynamic Power**: Energy used during active operations.
    - **Miss Penalty**: The energy cost of fetching data from lower memory levels.
- **Access Timeline**: (Coming Soon) A chronological view of memory access patterns.

### 4. Detailed Component Views
Dedicated pages for each level of the hierarchy:
- **CPU Core**: Execute RISC-V instructions and generate memory requests.
- **L1 & L2 Caches**: Inspect sets, ways, tags, and valid bits. Visualize eviction policies in action.
- **Main Memory (RAM)**: View the raw data storage and address mapping.
